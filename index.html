      <p id="intro"> Code is not new, but has been around for a very long time. In the Roman times code was used for shorthand writing systems. With the shift into
      the digital era (from WWII on) code has taken a particularly central function in our lives.
      Code has now been put into practice by new technology. This week we will be learning about JQuery and the Chrome developer Tool.
      Alan Turing was very comfortable with using these tools to destroy Nazi Germany.</p>
      <h2>Tasks</h2>
      
      <div id="tasks"><h3>Learn JQuery</h3>
      
      <p>jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side 
      scripting of HTML.Query's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, 
      select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. 
      jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the 
      JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level 
      interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, theme-able widgets. 
      The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic 
      web pages and web applications. Get familiar with it.</p>

      <div id="tasks2"><h3>Get familiar with the Chrome Developer Console</h3>
      
      <p> Get familiar with this JavaScript Console. It provides functions for developers testing web pages and applications. It is A place to log diagnostic information using methods provided by the Console API, such as console.log(), or console.profile()
      And it is also a shell prompt where you can enter commands and interact with the document and the Chrome DevTools. Directly in the Console, 
and can also use the methods provided by the Command Line API, or profile() to start the CPU profiler.
